/*
    Note: Here Function can also be called as Components and its first letter must be Capital
    Also, For file name, First Letter must be Capital, that is best Practice

    If some HTML element is returned from the Component then file name must be JSX
    In React, extension of file can also be JSX, it is optional
    Inclusion of JS in HTML can be in the browser after inspect element
